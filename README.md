# Generative AI-Driven Molecular Design: Combining Predictive Models and Reinforcement Learning for Tailored Molecule Generation

Welcome to the Molecule Generation repository! This repository contains code and resources related to generating novel molecules using various techniques.

# Folders
src: contains the source code for different components of the molecule generation pipeline. You'll find scripts, modules, and packages here that are used to implement the algorithms and methods involved in molecule generation.

data: store any necessary data files required for the molecule generation experiments. This could include datasets, preprocessed data, or any other data-related resources.

notebooks: contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase the step-by-step process of molecule generation.

models: save trained models, model weights, and any related artifacts.

reports: contains generated images.

# Getting Started
To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Explore the src folder to understand the codebase and algorithms.
Check out the notebooks folder for interactive examples and tutorials.
If you're using machine learning models, the models folder is where you can save and load trained models.
If you have any datasets or data resources, place them in the data folder.
Feel free to contribute, open issues, or submit pull requests if you have any improvements or ideas to share. Happy molecule generation!
